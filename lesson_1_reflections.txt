How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was a quick method to find the difference between two files and thereafter finding the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Dividing the work in modules and having access to previous versions can help recover the program if there is any mistake at any point of development.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: control over the program and if there is any error that is saved can be problematic. Can save one logical change at a time.
Cons: have to take care about saving every changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A program can have multiple files associated with it and can involve changing them simultaneously which is why git allow saving multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

diff log can be used to view info about each commit so far.
"diff commitID1 commitID2" can be used to compare the difference between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

We can keep track of our activities and have more confident in testing new techniques. We can always go back to our previous version and see where the bug was introduced using "git checkout commit-id"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For software development and be a effecient programmer.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created which means the repository is ready to be staged. It changes the directory to a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the part of git and it shows that the current directory is ready to be add to git. Working directory may or may not be a part of git and repository is created once the git is initialised. Staging makes our working directory a ready to be commited directory as git repository.
